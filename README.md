- Consistent metadata tagging (Navidrome-friendly)
- Embed thumbnails as cover artwork
- Organize downloads by playlist/album
- Skip duplicates using yt-dlp archive
- Support for multiple playlists
- Watchdog mode (auto-sync playlists)
- Network error handling with retries
- Download progress tracking
- Rate limiting to avoid IP blocking
- Comprehensive logging

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (optional, but recommended)

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Run the setup script to create necessary directories:

   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh

   # On Windows
   .\setup.ps1
   ```

3. Edit the `playlists.txt` file to add your YouTube Music playlist URLs (one per line)
4. Run the container using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

The downloaded MP3 files will be available in the `./downloads` directory, and logs in the `./logs` directory.

## Usage Options

### Using Docker Compose (recommended)

1. Edit the `playlists.txt` file with your playlist URLs
2. Run the container:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

To customize the MP3 quality:

```bash
MP3_QUALITY=192k docker-compose up
```

To enable rate limiting and add verbosity:

```bash
RATE_LIMIT=1 VERBOSE=1 docker-compose up
```

To specify additional arguments:

```bash
EXTRA_ARGS="--retries 5" docker-compose up
```

### Configuration File

The application also supports a YAML configuration file. By default, it looks for `config.yml` in the application directory.

Example configuration:

```yaml
# Output directory for downloaded files
output_dir: /downloads

# MP3 audio quality (e.g., 128k, 192k, 320k)
quality: 320k

# Enable rate limiting to avoid IP blocking (0=disabled, 1=enabled)
rate_limit: 0

# Maximum number of retries for failed downloads
max_retries: 3

# Log file path (leave empty for console-only logging)
log_file: /logs/ytm-downloader.log

# Verbose logging (0=normal, 1=verbose)
verbose: 0
```

To use a custom configuration file:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE=./my-custom-config.yml docker-compose up
```

### Using Docker directly

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t ytm-downloader .

# Download a single playlist
docker run -v "$(pwd)/downloads:/downloads" ytm-downloader "https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXXXXX"

# Download multiple playlists
docker run -v "$(pwd)/downloads:/downloads" ytm-downloader "https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXXXX" "https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyyyy"

# Download playlists from a file
docker run -v "$(pwd)/downloads:/downloads" -v "$(pwd)/playlists.txt:/app/playlists.txt:ro" ytm-downloader -f /app/playlists.txt
```

### Command-line Options

```bash
Usage: python main.py [OPTIONS] [URLS...]

Options:
  -o, --output-dir DIR     Directory to save downloaded files (default: ./downloads)
  -q, --quality QUALITY    MP3 audio quality (default: 320k)
  -f, --file FILE          Text file with playlist URLs (one per line)
  -r, --rate-limit         Enable rate limiting to avoid IP blocking
  --retries NUM            Number of retries for failed downloads (default: 3)
  --log-file FILE          Save logs to a file in addition to console output
  -v, --verbose            Enable verbose logging
  --help                   Show this help message
```

## Docker Image Details

The Docker image follows best practices:

- Uses multi-stage builds to reduce image size
- Runs as a non-root user for security
- Includes only necessary dependencies
- Uses specific version tags for reproducibility
